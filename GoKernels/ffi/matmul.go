// Go cgo c-shared kernel for the IN-PROCESS FFI path (ADR-0002). Built as a DLL and dlopen'd from
// TypeScript via bun:ffi — synchronous, zero IPC, so it can be a drop-in ComputeBackend. Requires
// a working C toolchain (gcc); build via PowerShell where MinGW gcc works cleanly (Git Bash
// shadows the toolchain and breaks cgo).
//
//   Build:  go build -buildmode=c-shared -o ../matmul.dll ./   (run from GoKernels/ffi)
//
// This file is the THREADING + FFI shell only; the arithmetic lives in matmul_avx.c (AVX2+FMA). The
// split is forced by cgo: a file using //export may only DECLARE C functions in its preamble, never
// define them.
//
// Why the inner loop is C, not Go: Go has no SIMD intrinsics, so a Go kernel stays scalar (it would
// need Plan9 assembly). Measured, the old scalar Go kernel ran ~16 GFLOP/s on a CPU capable of ~500,
// and was actually SLOWER per core than Bun's JIT — its only edge was goroutine parallelism. C+AVX2
// closes that gap while Go keeps doing what it is good at here: cheap fan-out across cores.
//
// THREE ENTRY POINTS, one forward + the two halves of the matmul backward:
//   MatMulF64   out = a @ b                 (transposes b internally, overwrites out)
//   MatMulNTF64 out (+)= a @ btᵀ            (bt ALREADY [N,K] row-major — zero transpose; dA half)
//   MatMulTNF64 db  (+)= aᵀ @ dout          (dedicated column kernel — zero transpose; dB half)
// The NT/TN pair exists because the TS backward used to transpose B and A on the JS side (single-
// threaded) just so it could call the forward entry — pure overhead, since dOut @ Bᵀ wants exactly
// the [N,K]-style layout B is already stored in, and Aᵀ @ dOut can read A's columns in place.
//
// NUMERICS: no longer bit-identical to the TS path (see matmul_avx.c) — vectorizing the k loop keeps
// 4 partial sums and FMA rounds once instead of twice. This was an explicit trade for the SIMD win;
// gradcheck's 1e-3 tolerance is the correctness guard.
